The atmosphere of the Solar-like stars is composed of the photosphere, chromosphere, transition zone, and corona. The chromosphere is the layer where the temperature goes from 4000 K to 8000 K and is studied at ultraviolet, visible, infrared, millimeter and (sub)-millimeter wavelengths (Wedemeyer et al. 2016)[^7].
The first chromospheric models were obtained thanks to the ultraviolet observations (Vernazza et al. 1981; Avrett & Loeser 2008)[^6] [^1]. However, recent observations made with the Solar Submillimeter Telescope (SST) and the Atacama Large Millimeter / Submillimeter Array (ALMA) have shown that the chromosphere has lower temperatures than expected by ultraviolet models (Linsky 2017). [^2]

We have developed the KINICH-PAKAL (Tapia-V치zquez, & De la Luz 2020)[^5] code that use the Levenberg-Marquard algorithm as a nonlinear fit method, PAKAL-MPI as a chromospheric model of the solar atmosphere, and observations at wavelengths ranging from infrared to millimeter to generate a more accurate model of the chromospheres of the solar-type stars.
KINICH-PAKAL has allowed us to study in detail how the physical conditions of the atmosphere change as a function of its effective temperature.
Developing these models is necessary for debris disk studies (White et al. 2018)[^8], study the conditions under which flares are formed (MacGregor et al.2018)[^4] and the possible physical mechanisms of flux variations in the stars (Liseau 2019)[^3].
