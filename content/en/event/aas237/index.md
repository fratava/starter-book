location: Virtual Meeting
#address:
#  street: 450 Serra Mall

#  region: CA
#  postcode: '94305'
#  country: United States

summary: Presentation No.116.01 in the session “Stellar Atmospheres and Winds”.
#abstract: "Stellar emission at infrared to centimeter wavelengths remains largely unconstrained since only a few stars other than the Sun have been observed at these wavelengths. This lack of observations means that radio stellar atmosphere models cannot be informed by data. In this work, we present a new methodology to fit the observed and synthetic spectrum of Altair through semiempirical models. We adapt both KINICH-PAKAL and PHOENIX models to reproduce Altair's radio spectra. KINICH-PAKAL is a new framework that allows adapting a solar chromospheric model to solar-like stars iteratively. KINICH-PAKAL uses the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as a Nonlinear method, PakalMPI as the semiempirical model, and the observations at infrared to centimeter wavelengths. Our results show that both PHOENIX and KINICH-PAKAL model reproduces the photosphere and lower chromosphere. However, the KINICH-PAKAL features allow to better model the part of the spectrum where the upper chromosphere and the corona have the major contribution. These results are part of an on-going observational campaign called The MESAS Project which seeks to Measure the Emission of Stellar Atmosphere at Submillimeter to millimeter wavelengths."

The dominant emission mechanisms at millimeter/submillimeter remain largely unknown for most spectral types other than Solar analogues. This is due in part to the lack of data to inform stellar atmosphere models. In this work, we present a new methodology to fit the observed and synthetic spectrum of main-sequence stars through semiempirical models[^2]. We use the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as a Nonlinear method, PakalMPI[^1] as the semiempirical model and the observations that are part of an ongoing observational campaign entitled Measuring the Emission of Stellar Atmospheres at Submillimeter/ Millimeter wavelengths[^5]. Our results show that we can use semiempirical models as an input model to reproduce and constrain the observed spectrum of main-sequence stars[^4]. In addition to a better understanding of stellar processes, these models are also essential for determining the stellar contribution to unresolved circumstellar disks at submillimeter/millimeter wavelengths[^3].
